# Event-driven syncs

drt runs when invoked — there is no drt-owned watcher process. Getting from
"a nightly sync" to "seconds after the source changes" is a choice of
*what invokes drt*, not a drt feature to turn on. [ADR 0004](../adr/0004-streaming-and-event-triggered-syncs.md)
answers that with three tiers, in the order to reach for them:

| Tier | What triggers drt | Best for | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Warehouse-native scheduling** | The warehouse's own scheduler (a cron job, a `TASK`) calling `drt run` or [`drt-action`](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt-action) | 1–15 minute freshness, zero drt-side runtime | Ships today, every source |
| **2. Dagster sensors** | `dagster-drt`'s `build_drt_change_sensor()` polling a cheap change signal | Teams already running Dagster | Ships today — Delta Lake, Iceberg, Snowflake, SQL Server |
| **3. Hardened `drt serve`** | A push source (webhook, Snowflake Alert, Pub/Sub) hitting drt's HTTP endpoint | Genuine push sources, sub-minute | Ships today |

None of these is a *drt-owned* watcher process — drt itself never runs as a
long-lived daemon polling for changes. Tiers 1 and 2 are exactly "drt starts,
syncs, and exits, invoked by something else." **Tier 3 is different**: `drt
serve` must stay running as a resident process to receive requests — it's
hardened precisely because it's the one path where something drt operates
needs to be up continuously. See ADR 0004's
[Decision](../adr/0004-streaming-and-event-triggered-syncs.md#decision)
section for why a drt-owned *watcher* (something that itself detects change,
as opposed to a listener that's told about it) was rejected, and the
[trigger matrix](../research/warehouse-trigger-matrix.md) for the
per-source research behind every recommendation below.

## Tier 1 — warehouse-native scheduling

The trigger lives where the data lands: a cron job, a cloud scheduler, or the
warehouse's own task scheduler invokes `drt run` (or the packaged
[`drt-action`](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt-action) GitHub Action) on an
interval. This is the default for every source drt supports and needs no new
infrastructure — see [`docs/guides/ci-cd-integration.md`](ci-cd-integration.md)
for the CI-runner shape of this pattern.

**This is also the recommended path for Snowflake and SQL Server today** —
with one requirement that's easy to get wrong. Both have a purpose-built
change signal — Snowflake `STREAM` + `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()`, SQL Server
Change Tracking — designed to be checked cheaply from *inside* the
warehouse's own scheduler: a Snowflake `TASK`'s `WHEN
SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA(...)` clause only runs the task body when the stream
actually has unconsumed rows.

**The task body must itself consume the stream via DML, or this doesn't
work at all.** A stream's offset only advances when it's read inside a DML
statement — plain querying never advances it (see the
[trigger matrix](../research/warehouse-trigger-matrix.md#snowflake)). If the
task body only invokes `drt run` via an external function or webhook and
never touches the stream with DML, nothing consumes it: `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()`
stays `TRUE` forever after the first real change, and the task keeps firing
— and its warehouse keeps spinning — indefinitely, whether or not anything
new has actually changed since the last run. This is the same
`STREAM_HAS_DATA()` consumption trap that ruled `STREAM` out as Tier 2's
Snowflake signal (see below — Tier 2 uses a different function that doesn't
have this problem), and it applies here just as much: give the task body an
explicit DML consumer, e.g. `INSERT INTO
<a_tracking_table> SELECT * FROM <stream>` alongside (or instead of) the
`drt run` invocation, so the stream's offset actually advances. A task that
only ever reads the stream through `WHEN`/`SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()` without
a DML consumer is not a working trigger, regardless of tier.

## Tier 2 — Dagster sensors

For teams already running a Dagster orchestrator, `dagster-drt` ships
`build_drt_change_sensor()`: a sensor that polls a cheap, metadata-only
change signal and fires one `RunRequest` per detected change. Dagster
supplies the durability, cursoring, and backfill semantics drt itself
doesn't have.

Keep destination quota boundaries in mind when a sensor fans out work:
separate OS processes do not share drt's default rate-limit bucket. Prefer
one `drt run --select state:modified --state <manifest>` process for a batch
of changed syncs, or register an external backend if exact cross-process
coordination is required. See [Rate limiting](rate-limiting.md).

```python
from dagster import Definitions
from dagster_drt import DagsterDrtResource, build_drt_change_sensor, drt_assets

@drt_assets(project_dir=".")
def my_syncs(context, drt: DagsterDrtResource):
    yield from drt.run(context=context)

change_sensor = build_drt_change_sensor(
    project_dir=".",
    asset_selection=[my_syncs],
    minimum_interval_seconds=60,
)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[my_syncs],
    sensors=[change_sensor],
    resources={"drt": DagsterDrtResource(project_dir=".")},
)
```

For a Snowflake profile, `watch_table=` and `minimum_interval_seconds=` are
both required (see the cost note below):

```python
change_sensor = build_drt_change_sensor(
    project_dir=".",
    asset_selection=[my_syncs],
    watch_table="MY_DB.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE",
    minimum_interval_seconds=300,  # a deliberate choice, not a default
)
```

### Supported sources: Delta Lake, Iceberg, Snowflake, SQL Server

`build_drt_change_sensor()` supports four profile types, each reading a
cheap, metadata-only signal and comparing the two most recent values for
*equality* only — never ordering, so an opaque-but-unique identifier works
exactly as well as a genuinely monotonic counter:

- **`deltalake`** — `DeltaTable.version()`, a monotonically increasing integer.
- **`iceberg`** — `current_snapshot().snapshot_id`, an opaque, generated
  identifier — unique per snapshot but not ordered (Iceberg's own monotonic
  field is `sequence_number`; `snapshot_id` can move to an *older* snapshot
  on a table rollback).
- **`snowflake`** — `SYSTEM$LAST_CHANGE_COMMIT_TIME('<table>')`. Requires
  `watch_table=` (fully-qualified table name) **and**
  `minimum_interval_seconds=` on `build_drt_change_sensor()` — see the cost
  note below.
- **`sqlserver`** — `CHANGE_TRACKING_CURRENT_VERSION()`. The polled signal
  itself is database-scoped, so it fires on *any* tracked table's change,
  not only the one a given sync targets — coarser than the other three, but
  not unsafe: an extra sensor-triggered run just finds nothing new to sync.
  Also requires `watch_table=`, used only to *validate* that the specific
  table is itself change-tracked (`CHANGE_TRACKING_MIN_VALID_VERSION`) —
  without it, a database with `CHANGE_TRACKING` enabled overall but the
  target table never separately enabled (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE
  CHANGE_TRACKING` is its own opt-in on top of the database-level one) would
  silently never see that table's changes, since the database-wide version
  keeps advancing from *other* tracked tables regardless. Caught in Codex
  review before this shipped. Raises `ValueError` at evaluation time for
  either failure mode — an untracked `watch_table` or `CHANGE_TRACKING` not
  enabled at all — naming the likely cause rather than silently returning a
  dead signal.

Snowflake and SQL Server were originally ruled out here (see the ADR 0004
amendment) because the trigger matrix's *recommended* signals for
both — `STREAM` + `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA()`, and an earlier unverified
assumption about SQL Server's retention semantics — turned out not to fit a
cursor-diff sensor: a stream's `HAS_DATA` boolean only resets when
*consumed* via DML, which drt's read-only extraction never does, so it would
flip `false → true` once and then latch permanently `true` — the sensor
would fire exactly once, ever, and then go silently quiet even as real
changes kept accumulating. `SYSTEM$LAST_CHANGE_COMMIT_TIME` and
`CHANGE_TRACKING_CURRENT_VERSION()` are different functions with no such
consumption semantics — verified against real accounts in
[#975](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/975), which is why they're
supported here instead. `SYSTEM$LAST_CHANGE_COMMIT_TIME`'s
warehouse-independence is further verified in
[#985](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/985)
(`tests/integration/dwh/test_snowflake_smoke.py::test_snowflake_last_change_commit_time_does_not_require_active_warehouse`).

**Snowflake's poll does *not* have a warehouse-compute cost** — verified
live against a real account
([#985](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/985)): deliberately
suspending the smoke warehouse, calling `SYSTEM$LAST_CHANGE_COMMIT_TIME`,
and confirming the warehouse stayed `SUSPENDED` afterward, rather than
`AUTO_RESUME`-ing the way an ordinary data query would. The signal call is
metadata-only. What it does have — like every profile type here — is a
real per-poll connection cost: `snowflake.connector.connect()` runs a full
auth handshake (private-key decrypt included, when `private_key_env` is
set) on every tick. Without a deliberate poll interval, Dagster's default
tick cadence would repeat that handshake far more often than any real
source needs — `minimum_interval_seconds=` is a required argument for a
Snowflake profile precisely so this is a choice you make, not a default
you inherit. SQL Server's `pymssql.connect()` opens a fresh connection per
tick too and isn't free either, so `minimum_interval_seconds=` is required
there for the identical reason (#1051 — this used to be a real, documented
asymmetry in this module; it no longer is).

```python
change_sensor = build_drt_change_sensor(
    project_dir=".",
    asset_selection=[my_syncs],
    watch_table="dbo.MyTable",
    minimum_interval_seconds=300,  # a deliberate choice, not a default
)
```

**Upgrading from dagster-drt < 0.5.0:** a SQL Server sensor definition that
didn't already pass `minimum_interval_seconds=` will start raising
`ValueError` at evaluation time after upgrading. Add the argument — there
is no compatibility default, for the same reason Snowflake never had one:
picking an interval is a decision about your own database's tolerance for
poll-connection overhead, not something dagster-drt can safely guess.

Calling `build_drt_change_sensor()` against any other profile type raises
`NotImplementedError` at evaluation time — a failed sensor tick in the
Dagster UI, not a silent permanent skip, so a misconfiguration is visible
rather than quietly inert. A supported profile missing a required argument
(`watch_table=` for Snowflake/SQL Server, plus `minimum_interval_seconds=`
for both) or returning an unusable signal (`NULL`) raises `ValueError`
the same way. A missing optional driver (`snowflake-connector-python`,
`pymssql`, `deltalake`, `pyiceberg` — none of them are in dagster-drt's base
install) raises `ImportError`, also propagated rather than treated as a
transient, retry-worthy skip.

### Deployment note: the sensor process needs the source profile

`_current_signal()` resolves the project's profile via
`drt.config.credentials.load_profile()` — the same profile lookup `drt run`
uses — which reads `~/.drt/profiles.yml` (or the equivalent secret-provider
URIs, see [`secret-provider-uris.md`](secret-provider-uris.md)) on whatever
host evaluates the sensor. A Dagster sensor runs inside the **Dagster
daemon**, not inside a job run's own container — so the daemon's host needs
the same source credentials available that a `drt run` invocation would,
**in addition to, not instead of**, the job run's own environment: when a
`RunRequest` fires, `DagsterDrtResource.run()` calls `load_profile()`
independently inside the job's own container. If your job runs execute in a
different container or host than the daemon (common with containerized
Dagster deployments), both need the source profile — the daemon to evaluate
the sensor, the job to actually run the sync. Missing it on the daemon side
only shows up as a sensor tick failure; missing it on the job side shows up
as a successful sensor tick followed by a failed sync run, which is easy to
misdiagnose as unrelated.

### State and remote backends

The sensor's own "has the source moved" signal is tracked entirely by
Dagster's sensor cursor (`context.update_cursor()`) — it is deliberately
**not** wired to drt's own state (`StateStore`/`WatermarkStorage`). Once a
`RunRequest` fires and Dagster launches the actual sync, that run reads and
writes drt's state exactly as it always has, through `DagsterDrtResource.run()`.
If you're running that resource against a remote `state.backend: gcs | s3`
project (see [`remote-state.md`](remote-state.md)), it now correctly routes
through the same `StatePersistingObserver` path the CLI uses.

## Tier 3 — hardened `drt serve`

For push sources — a webhook, a Snowflake Alert, a Pub/Sub push subscription
— `drt serve` is a hardened HTTP endpoint with a real delivery contract:
`202` + run id instead of holding the request open, same-sync coalescing
instead of dropping concurrent triggers, and pluggable `none`/`bearer`/`hmac`
auth. See [`using-webhook-trigger.md`](using-webhook-trigger.md) for the full
endpoint reference.

**Snowflake's recommended Tier 3 path**: a Snowflake Alert with a `STREAM`
condition, configured to hit `drt serve`'s `/sync/<name>` endpoint via
`WEBHOOK`. It's still Snowflake-side scheduled compute evaluating the
condition — the trigger matrix is explicit that this "wraps a poll" rather
than creating genuinely new push capability — and the **same DML-consumption
requirement from Tier 1 applies here too**: an Alert's condition check is
read-only, exactly like a `TASK`'s `WHEN` clause, so something still needs to
consume the stream via DML or the alert keeps firing on a stream that never
resets. What this path buys over Tier 1 is delivery shape (a webhook hit,
landing on drt serve's `202` + coalescing contract) — not an exemption from
the consumption requirement.

## Choosing a tier

- **Already fresh enough with a schedule?** Stay on Tier 1. It's zero
  drt-side runtime and covers most "fresh enough" requirements (1–15
  minutes).
- **Running Dagster, and the source is Delta Lake or Iceberg?** Tier 2 —
  `build_drt_change_sensor()` gives genuine event-driven activation for
  free (an object-storage metadata read, no connection or warehouse-compute
  cost), reusing plumbing you already have.
- **Running Dagster, and the source is Snowflake or SQL Server?** Tier 2
  works (`watch_table=` + `minimum_interval_seconds=` required for both).
  Neither poll has warehouse-compute cost (verified live for Snowflake,
  #985), but every tick opens a fresh authenticated connection — set
  `minimum_interval_seconds=` to something that reflects what that
  connection overhead is worth versus Tier 1 (native `TASK`/scheduling,
  already warehouse-scheduled) and Tier 3 (Alert/webhook — no drt-side
  polling, though the Alert's own condition check still "wraps a poll" on
  the warehouse side, as noted below).
- **A push source with no orchestrator in the picture** (GitHub webhook, dbt
  Cloud job completion, a vendor's own webhook)? Tier 3.

None of these require a drt-owned *watcher*, and none of them lock you in.
Tier 1 needs no new infrastructure — the warehouse's own scheduler already
exists. Tier 2 is additive on top of an orchestrator you're already running.
Tier 3 does need something new to operate: `drt serve` as a resident process
that stays up to receive requests — lightweight and hardened, but not
zero-runtime the way Tiers 1 and 2 are.
