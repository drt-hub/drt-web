# HubSpot Destination

> Upsert contacts, deals, or companies into HubSpot CRM.

## YAML Example

```yaml
destination:
  type: hubspot
  object_type: contacts
  id_property: email
  properties_template: |
    {
      "email": "{{ row.email }}",
      "firstname": "{{ row.first_name }}",
      "lastname": "{{ row.last_name }}",
      "company": "{{ row.company }}"
    }
  auth:
    type: bearer
    token_env: HUBSPOT_TOKEN
```

## Configuration

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"hubspot"` | — | Required |
| `object_type` | `contacts\|deals\|companies` | `contacts` | CRM object type |
| `id_property` | string | `email` | Property used for upsert deduplication |
| `properties_template` | string \| null | null | Jinja2 template for properties JSON |
| `auth` | BearerAuth | — | Bearer token auth |

## Authentication

Create a [Private App](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/private-apps) in HubSpot with CRM scopes, then:

```bash
export HUBSPOT_TOKEN="pat-na1-xxxxxxxx"
```

```yaml
auth:
  type: bearer
  token_env: HUBSPOT_TOKEN
```

## Common Patterns

**Upsert contacts by email:**
```yaml
object_type: contacts
id_property: email
properties_template: '{"email": "{{ row.email }}", "firstname": "{{ row.name }}"}'
```

**Create deals:**
```yaml
object_type: deals
id_property: dealname
properties_template: |
  {
    "dealname": "{{ row.deal_name }}",
    "amount": "{{ row.amount }}",
    "pipeline": "default",
    "dealstage": "{{ row.stage }}"
  }
```

**Without template (send record fields as-is):**
```yaml
object_type: contacts
id_property: email
# record fields are sent directly as HubSpot properties
```

**Enrich existing contacts only — never create (`match_policy: update_only`, [#757](https://github.com/drt-hub/drt/issues/757)):**
```yaml
sync:
  mode: upsert
  match_policy: update_only   # upsert (default) | update_only | create_only
destination:
  type: hubspot
  object_type: contacts
  id_property: email
```

The classic reverse-ETL activation case: push warehouse-computed scores/traits into contacts your reps already created in HubSpot, **without spraying a new contact for every warehouse row**. `update_only` PATCHes by `id_property` directly — a record with no HubSpot match (404) is **skipped**, never created. `create_only` is the inverse: POST only, and a record that already exists (409) is **skipped**, so a seed audience is never overwritten. Skipped rows are counted in the run's `skipped` total (`drt run` prints `… N skipped`), not as errors. The default `upsert` is unchanged (POST, then PATCH on 409).

## Rate limiting

**Vendor limit:** ~100 requests / 10s for private apps. **drt caps this destination at 9 req/s** and will not exceed it even if you configure a higher number.

The limiter is shared per **portal** — keyed on the access token, *not* on `object_type`. Syncing `contacts` and `companies` into the same portal concurrently (`drt run --threads 4`) paces them through one bucket, matching how HubSpot actually meters the quota. Before v0.8.4 each sync built its own limiter, so four parallel syncs put 4x the intended rate on one portal.

Override to go **lower** than the cap:

```yaml
destination:
  type: hubspot
  object_type: contacts
  rate_limit:
    requests_per_second: 4   # gentler than the 9/s cap
    burst: 8                 # optional: let idle time bank up to 8 requests
```

`destination.rate_limit` beats `sync.rate_limit`, which beats the default of 10/s. When two syncs share a portal but request different rates, the lowest wins for both.

> **Syncing to more than one portal? Use `auth.token_env`, not an inline `auth.token`.**
> Pacing is per portal, and drt identifies the portal by the *name* of the env var holding the token — it deliberately never derives the key from the token value itself. Two destinations that inline a literal token are therefore indistinguishable to the limiter and share one bucket, so they pace against each other even when they point at different portals. The failure mode is a slower sync, never a 429; giving each portal its own env var gives each its own bucket.

## Notes

- HubSpot rate limit: ~100 requests/10s for private apps. drt caps at 9 req/s automatically
- Upsert: POST with `idProperty` deduplicates. On 409 Conflict, drt retries as PATCH. `sync.match_policy: update_only` / `create_only` narrow this to one side (see Common Patterns above)
- `properties_template` must produce a JSON object of HubSpot property names
